# Movie_Code
This is my Django-Python Assignment  wherein I have built a simple and basic functionality of adding and viewing movie posters.

The steps are as mentioned below:

  1. Pull the code to your local machine.
  2. Install all the dependancies needed for the project using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
  3. Run the code to see if your dependancies have been installed and the pproject is running
  4. Create super user using "python manage.py createsuperuse"
  5. Login using the same Username and Password
  6. For user, run the code and "Sign Up" and then Login to check the posters.
